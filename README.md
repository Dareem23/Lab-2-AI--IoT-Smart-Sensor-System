# Lab-2-AI--IoT-Smart-Sensor-System
This lab walks through the complete Data Science workflow using Python — from defining the engineering objective, collecting data, preprocessing, handling missing values, performing EDA, and preparing the dataset for modeling.
## 🎯 Lab Objective

The objective of this lab is to walk through the **end-to-end Data Science pipeline** using Python.  
Using the *Household Power Consumption* dataset, the goal is to:

- Understand and define the engineering problem  
- Identify inputs (features) and output (target)  
- Load and preprocess real-world time-series data  
- Handle missing values and convert data types  
- Explore the dataset using visualizations  
- Prepare the cleaned dataset for future regression modeling

**Main Engineering Question:**  
Can we predict the next period’s **Global Active Power (kW)** using historical electrical measurements such as voltage, intensity, and sub-meter readings?

**Problem Type:**  
Regression — because the target is a continuous numerical value.
